# Shaka Lab Packages - Homebrew Tap

## Overview

The Shaka Lab project is all the software needed to replicate the private lab
environment used to build and test Shaka Player, Shaka Packager, and others.

[Homebrew taps](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) (which host macOS package formulae)
require a specific GitHub naming convention and repository layout, which this
repository satisfies.  It is built and deployed automatically from
[shaka-project/shaka-lab](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-lab).
